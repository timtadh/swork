SWORK
=====

Command line utility to start up enviroments for particular projects. Project configuration scripts
can be any executable file and are associated with a particular project via config.py. The utility
saves the enviroment variables that exist before its execution and restores them as necessary.

Swork is still in an early stage but should be useful at the end of today. (hopefully by this
morning in fact). My intention is to incrementally improve it as my needs evolve. I have previously
written very complex enviroment management tools for particular projects. Facing the prospect of
making yet another project specific tool, I decided to write general purpose extensible tool.
